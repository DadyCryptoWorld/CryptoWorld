### Problem

The adoption of Web3 by mainstream is still faraway. To fixe it, we need to focus on two dimensions: individuals & professionals


**Individuals face :**

Technical barrier in their interactions with blockchain 

Lack of knowledge of the technological aspect

Difficulties to rely on and trust the ecosystem (scam, speculation...)



**Professional has a real challenge to:**

Propose a new customer's experience and innovate in the way of operating their services by themselves (lack of time, back-end oriented, etc)

Get visibility in the web 3 space and make efficient customer acquisition



### Solution

ðŸ’¡ **To meet these challenges, we have built a metaverse based on "Web3 as a service" concept.**
This concept states that, to create a robust ecosystem in the long term, we need to offer a new support that:

Facilitate access to blockchain and related services by changing the user experience

Enable Web3 professionals to get a better visibility and new support to operate with an easy-to-use tool

Build around a community approach rather than a financial one, promoting mutual support among all web3 stakeholder
